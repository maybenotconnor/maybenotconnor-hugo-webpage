## Harmony's House
Harmony's House was produced for the 2024 New Haven 48 Hour Film Project. The required elements were the genre of Musical Drama, Jaden Starboard the Treasurer, an avocado, and the line "She left you a message." The film is about three siblings who inherit their grandmother's house but disagree on its fate. It was originally filmed in which the lines were sung, but the team made the difficult decision to use valuable time reshooting with spoken lines.

## Later, Maybe 
Later, Maybe was the first longer form, dialogue-heavy film Connor had made. With the help of Kathryn Walsh-Scott and Rebecca Ristow, the film had changed massively since its initial plan of being a stage play. The script had be written as filming occurred, with many life and logistic obstacles along the way. Overall, the group came out of it with new friends, memories, and experiences.

## A Killer Hand
A Killer Hand was a warm-up project for a few more films to be made. It is a parody of Casino Royale. There was no script, and the film has many technical flaws as well. The final product is amusing and was a fun experience for all involved.

## Happier Home

## The Little Red Prey
The Little Red Prey was created as part of ECSU Drama Society's Crunch Time 48 film festival. It was produced with a team of five people in 48 hours and was not written by Connor, and was co-directed with Rebecca Ristow. Because of this it is not Connor's style of film but still shows similarities to others he has made. The prompt for this film was 'keeping secrets' and must include the line "I am a speck of dust. Smaller than a speck of dust. A small speck of dust."

## One Step at a Time
One Step at a Time was produced in Seattle, Washington as part of The Student Television Network Convention's Crazy 8 Short Film challenge. This was produced with a crew of about 12 members in less than 8 hours. The film is far from finished, but goes to show what is possible in such a short amount of time. The biggest takeaway from this project was to have less walking and more plot!

## Watergate
Watergate is a collaboration between two teams that had not previously worked together. This Connor-directed, group-written film was given the prompt of using "What If?", and includes a cameo with the high school principal. Watergate does not have an extended version, being stated because some have said it appears to be a trailer for something more in the future.

## Second Chance
Second Chance is one of the most creative films on this list. Produced for a midterm project, the film was rushed to be completed in the final stages. Risks were taken in this film and it is clearly imperfect, but looking past some of the faults results in an interesting take on the afterlife. It is loosely based on the TV show Lucifer, which Connor hadn't seen.

## The Doodler
The Doodler is Connor's first large film project. This film tests usage of visual effects and basic CG, standing it out from others. The Doodler was not a fan favorite due to slow pacing and failed emotional attachment, but its ability to try something different won it 2nd place in the 2018 HK Film Festival.
