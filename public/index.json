Written and directed all in the final six months of university, it took the following two years to edit. The feature-length film follows Becca, a soon-to-be college graduate, navigating decisions in her future career and love life.   Fanta Clown  #   Fanta Clown was Jordan\u0026rsquo;s 22nd birthday video. From idea to upload in less than 8 hours, there are compromises on quality, though none on humor. It was produced soley by Connor and Rebecca Ristow.   John\u0026rsquo;s 50th Birthday Video  #   John\u0026rsquo;s 50th Birthday Video was written and directed by Jordan Madaus, his first experience in having final cut priviledge on a film. Filmed and edited by Connor Chute, the duo created the film while the rest of the typical crew was in quarantine with Covid-19. The film was created to celebrate the 50th birthday of John Madaus, his father, in an improvised Avengers: Endgame parody.   Bad to Bratwurst  #   Bad to Bratwurst was produced for the 2022 ECSU 48 Hour Film Festival, Connor\u0026rsquo;s last. The film was made with the largest team of 8 people. The silly nature is controversial, but elicited a humorous reaction from many. Bad to Bratwurst won best editing and best overall.   Later, Maybe  #   Later, Maybe was the first longer form, dialogue-heavy film Connor had made. With the help of Kathryn Walsh-Scott and Rebecca Ristow, the film had changed massively since its initial plan of being a stage play. The script had be written as filming occurred, with many life and logistic obstacles along the way. Overall, the group came out of it with new friends, memories, and experiences.   A Killer Hand  #   A Killer Hand was a warm-up project for a few more films to be made. It is a parody of Casino Royale. There was no script, and the film has many technical flaws as well. The final product is amusing and was a fun experience for all involved.   Happier Home  #   Happier Home was Connor\u0026rsquo;s final project for his only filmmaking class, produced almost entirely alone. The prompt was a character attempting to make a change in their life without any dialogue. Production was done over a weekend and the script was written in a day.   Slim Jim  #   Slim Jim was produced for a class assignment with the prompt \u0026lsquo;locked out\u0026rsquo; and had to include a variety of shot types. This film took only 4 hours and contains no production sound, replaced entirely by foley.   Quilkshake  #   Quilkshake was produced for the ECSU Film and Media Club Spring 2021 48 Hour Film Festival. It is an idiot comedy that was completed in a day. The competition required the usage of a plumber character and the line \u0026ldquo;I drink your milkshake.\u0026rdquo;   The Little Red Prey  #   The Little Red Prey was created as part of ECSU Drama Society\u0026rsquo;s Crunch Time 48 film festival. It was produced with a team of five people in 48 hours and was not written by Connor, and was co-directed with Rebecca Ristow. Because of this it is not Connor\u0026rsquo;s style of film but still shows similarities to others he has made. The prompt for this film was \u0026lsquo;keeping secrets\u0026rsquo; and must include the line \u0026ldquo;I am a speck of dust. Smaller than a speck of dust. A small speck of dust.\u0026rdquo;   Spotted Red Suits  #   Spotted Red Suits is a short scene Connor put together after finally watching The Godfather. Filmed without a camera operator, Connor finds pride in the single-day turnaround time it was produced in.   Matrimony \u0026amp; Keys  #   Matrimony \u0026amp; Keys is a silly film that was written and produced from start to finish all in 48 hours. It was for Eastern\u0026rsquo;s first annual 48 Hour Film Festival, which required that it used the prop of an umbrella, the character of a gym junkie, and the line \u0026ldquo;It takes two to tango.\u0026rdquo; Matrimony \u0026amp; Keys won Best Film Overall.   Atsumori  #   Atsumori is a historical piece representing a modern adaptation of the Japanese Samurai legend of Taira Atsumori and Kumagai Noazane. Atsumori was produced for a final class project with a crew of only four and recorded mostly in three hours.   BUSTED  #   BUSTED is Connor\u0026rsquo;s high school senior capstone. It depicts two high school boys getting lost in the woods on the run from the law. It had the largest budget of all films up to this point. BUSTED was entered in the annual HK spring film festival in 2019, in which it won 3rd place.   One Step at a Time  #   One Step at a Time was produced in Seattle, Washington as part of The Student Television Network Convention\u0026rsquo;s Crazy 8 Short Film challenge. This was produced with a crew of about 12 members in less than 8 hours. The film is far from finished, but goes to show what is possible in such a short amount of time. The biggest takeaway from this project was to have less walking and more plot!   Watergate  #   Watergate is a collaboration between two teams that had not previously worked together. This Connor-directed, group-written film was given the prompt of using \u0026ldquo;What If?\u0026rdquo;, and includes a cameo with the high school principal. Watergate does not have an extended version, being stated because some have said it appears to be a trailer for something more in the future.   Second Chance  #   Second Chance is one of the most creative films on this list. Produced for a midterm project, the film was rushed to be completed in the final stages. Risks were taken in this film and it is clearly imperfect, but looking past some of the faults results in an interesting take on the afterlife. It is loosely based on the TV show Lucifer, which Connor hadn\u0026rsquo;t seen.   The Doodler  #   The Doodler is Connor\u0026rsquo;s first large film project. This film tests usage of visual effects and basic CG, standing it out from others. The Doodler was not a fan favorite due to slow pacing and failed emotional attachment, but its ability to try something different won it 2nd place in the 2018 HK Film Festival.   Because She\u0026rsquo;s Mine  #   Because She\u0026rsquo;s Mine was produced for the Student Television Network Convention\u0026rsquo;s 6 hour Silent Film competition. It the first publicly available film Connor directed and edited. The prompt was \u0026ldquo;I walk the line\u0026rdquo;, and the film is a reference to the Johnny Cash song by the same name.

I purchased her in December 2019 from a family who had enough cars and needed to downsize. No noticeable problems at 147,000 miles and cost $3k. I named her Janice, which seemed fitting for a granny car and at this point I had no idea to what she would become.     Once I took her home I knew I wanted her to be a bit beefier and be somewhat off-road capable. Ordered a cheap $100 roof rack from China and struggled to put it together without instructions but it looks good and saved a lot of money.   When I got her I knew she\u0026rsquo;d need new tires soon, so before winter break ended I put on some 215/65/r16 General Grabbers new from Walmart. Worst customer service experience I\u0026rsquo;ve ever had, but 4 weeks later I had some new shoes. In retrospect, I wish I had gotten larger tires since I was buying new and would eventually find these too small.   Janice got about a two month hiatus while I focused on my studies at uni, but right before I knew I couldn\u0026rsquo;t stand the audio so it was time for a sound upgrade. I installed a bluetooth headunit with voice controls and new speakers all around. I opted for cheap BOSS speakers in the doors which I was told I would regret, but even after 6 month I have seen no problems with them. I also got an all-in-one subwoofer and amp to install under the trunk panel where the jack was stored. I cut a plywood panel to cover where I removed the foam panel, but had to constantly cover it with a blanket to prevent rattle. Eventually I modified the original foam insert to fit over the sub and be able to open up to uncover when that little bit more bass was needed.     Didn\u0026rsquo;t do much modding in this time and didn\u0026rsquo;t feel the need to, but Janice had some good adventures. The photos below I refer to as \u0026lsquo;Fire and Ice\u0026rsquo;, and were only a week apart. Completely unintentional. It was also this time that I finally realized that a rear headrest was missing (how do you lose that?) so I looked for a while but found the right color on ebay for only $40.     As the Covid-19 outbreak hit the US, I was sent home from uni and had a lot of spare time. I decided to paint some parts of the car to give a more aggressive look. Started with the front bumper as shown below but added skirts, mirror caps, gas cap, and C pillar to all black.   Since I had been helping my brother build his dream jeep (left) for a while, some mods that were done to it would also be done to the new forester. This silly photo shows our new light bars. Janice got four pod flood lights on her roof rack, wired with a relay. I wish that I had made the center two spot lights but did not initially because they were slightly more expensive. These were all cheap Nilight brand but worked great for our purposes.       It was my first time camping since the forester and I decided it would be more comfortable to sleep in the back with the seats folded down. While being 5'10\u0026quot; I surely had enough space and was warm, the trunk is not comfortable to lay on. If to be done again, would need a real mattress pad.   I had planned to plastidip the rims since I got the car, but the silver looked fine so I delayed. Eventually spring came closer so it was the first opportunity for proper drying and I took it. I had purchased metalizer and planned for an anthracite grey finish, but once the black coats went on I noticed how well they fit the color scheme of the car, and that is what I still have today.     150k!! So proud of her! At this point only repairs that had been done in my possession were fluid changes, new timing belts, idle pulley bolt, and air filters. I didn\u0026rsquo;t realize it would be in the next 2k miles we\u0026rsquo;d lose the AC compressor clutch and drivers door window motor, but both were repaired alone very inexpensively.     Put Janice to work a bit while doing the picnic table boat project [in the videos section of this site]. It was a blast bringing her to pick up lumber and seeing the looks from guys with large trucks.     The summer was very hot so I tinted the windows 30% on my own. The door windows were easy to do but I tried and failed with the rears. They will remain untinted until I determine it\u0026rsquo;s worth paying a professional. The hardest mod of this time was locking the center differential solenoid via wiring around the TCM. After doing it incorrectly the second try again and almost killing the car, I took a break. Eventually was able to complete the mod giving Janice 4wd on demand. It turned out that a family member had a small vinyl cutter and I was completely unaware! I loved the jdm forester \u0026lsquo;f\u0026rsquo; so I cut some new badges. The rear badges needed some work too so I plastidipped them and added some vinyl mountains. I also planned to add a MtnRoo sticker and my website link, but never got around to learning how to make these complex cuts.     As August came around I really enjoyed modding the car (and even the repairs! :P) but realized there was only so much aftermarket for the forester. I also couldn\u0026rsquo;t justify the money for just shelling out money for a big lift yet. I decided to pick up some fabrication skills and got my first angle grinder. The lift kit was the most important but was put on the backburner because I felt I needed more skills to make proper subframe spacers. I did not like how bare the hood had looked, so I ordered some air duct vents for very cheap and added hood struts while under there. I past the point of no return on the car when I first cut the holes in the hood to cover with vents. This was the crossing where Janice became Jan, needing a little bit cooler of a name. The next fab mod was when my brother\u0026rsquo;s jeep had outgrown its bumper and needed a different one to fit its aesthetic. Well guess what we did with the old one? To make it fit we removed the crash bar from Jan and cut the edges of the jeep bumper to fit over it. We used a 2x4 as a spacer and bolted the bumper into the crash bar. We remounted the the forester and cut the stock bumper to fit over. This got it very scratched in the process but the look was worth it.         I had planned for this mod since I first got the car with it being so simple but didn\u0026rsquo;t think I had the skills to make it myself. Below are the blueprints for the skid plate that I designed but in reality, they weren\u0026rsquo;t necessary because I eyeballed it by sitting under the car and drawing on the skid plate beside me where to cut. The photo below is not the final version because it required spacers to not press against the exhaust but I was proud of it.     On the same day as the skid plate, I picked up some 4x4 angle aluminum to replace the now cracking skirts. I cut the angle to size and bedlined it, then bolted right into where the clip holes were with some modification to the surrounding trim of course. I added some rubber edgeliner to the top edge and they now function much better than stock and protect the body.     Two days before moving back to university, my snorkel kit finally arrived. I had ordered it 5 months earlier, but US Customs had held onto it for inspection. All I needed to do those two days was an oil change, so I decided to do the snorkel install as well. I used a mitsubishi pajero snorkel as many do, but struggled to get it to fit. Also, I was cutting at the fender without a hole saw, and couldn\u0026rsquo;t even remove it without taking off the bumper assembly.   After finally getting the snorkel attached but not yet molded, I took it for a ride to pick up some lunch. Turns out I didn\u0026rsquo;t do a very good job of tightening the snorkel head hose clamp, so I lost it off the side of the highway. I then decided to ratchet strap the main pipe to the passenger seat until I molded and riveted it in. I ordered a new snorkel head and it came about a week later.   This oil change became the worst oil change anyone could imagine due to Mobil over-tightening the nontraditional sized filter, which took 6 hours to remove, including 4 trips to the auto parts store. I also changed the transmission fluid and filter, but the trans filter was the original on the car - over 14 years old! Ruined a pair of clothes both days but am glad to know she\u0026rsquo;s running right.   Thought it would be cool to get the forester drawn by @marksdrawingagain and it came out great! Going to make some stickers from these, and he did the jeep as well.     Took the forester on her first real road trip and snapped the picture above. Going into winter, it was apparent that she was too low - it was time to lift.\nI purchased a set of feal 441 maxtravel coilovers. While I had these for a while, the car remained at stock height for 8 months. Once I finally found time, I had one week for the installation. I thought it would have taken one day, but being in the rust belt adds quite an extension.   The new coilovers were too tall to fit and were seized, preventing being able to shorten them. After a few days of trying every method imaginable, I had to cut the collars. I did not raise the ride height too much as the sway bars greatly limited the downward travel. I had to replace the endlinks with extended ones.     During the install, I accidentally pulled the front passenger cv joint apart. Over the next few weeks I would repeatedly regrease the joint and push the boot back on, but it was clear the axle would have to be removed from the car. This would be a later task. I first decided to tackle the bumper v2, as I had feared the 2x4 breaking and the bumper falling off.\nI fabricated a steel adapter for the jeep bumper to mount to the crash bar bolts on the subaru. It went off without much of a hitch and was very strong. I cut the remainder of the front bumper off, making the vehicle much less aerodynamic, albeit cooler looking.   After taking some road trips, the axle got worse and worse. I pulled 2 front axles from a parts car and prepared to do a full replacement. The replacement went cleanly, and the car was set to just ride as it is. I eventually ended up having to repeat this process 4 times.   In Summer 2022, I purchased a 2005 Mini Cooper S Convertible, leaving Jan to have a break. With gas prices over $5, Jan was downgraded to a work car at 170,000 miles.     Winter 2022 Jan was once again my daily driver, though suffered from a rainy day and an open window to being filled with water. I removed all the carpets and cleaned out the water, putting in vinegar to prevent any mold. After dehumidifying for over two weeks she was good as new.   Early 2023 I recognized the days of me owning this car are numbered, and as I matured I was getting ready to move on to other projects (and more expensive vehicles). My dream had been to drive Janice on the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah. My best friend and I made an itinerary and set out in May 2023. The video can be found on my YouTube channel.   Just a few hours in we realized that it would not be possible to make it to Utah in the time we had. We rerouted, the new furthest west destination being Wentzville, MO.\nThis trip was the last for Jan. I began searching for a new car once we returned, and settled on a Volkswagen Tiguan.   On December 30th, 2023, I sold Jan for $2,000. In the last few months of ownership, an exhaust leak and a steering misalignment developed. And with the new VW, I ran out of space to store it. She was at 180,000 miles.\nIt was sad to see her go. I loved that car, and the memories made in it will remain with me forever.\n   \n","date":"1 January 0001","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/jan-the-forester/","section":"","summary":"A sort-of blog about my project 2007 Subaru Forester  ‎ ‎","title":"Jan the Forester","type":"featured"},{"content":"Mystcraft Data Pack at Planet Minecraft by MaybeNotConnor\n   maybenotconnor/mystcraft_datapack   Datapack addon for Minecraft Java Edition based on the popular game MYST  mcfunction     1     0     fetch(\"https://api.github.com/repos/maybenotconnor/mystcraft_datapack\", { headers: new Headers({ 'User-agent': 'Mozilla/4.0 Custom User Agent' }) }) .then(response = response.json()) .then(data = { document.getElementById('github-7511afe3fc97f565d0d55f9a83e2273e-full_name').innerHTML = data.full_name; document.getElementById('github-7511afe3fc97f565d0d55f9a83e2273e-description').innerHTML = data.description; document.getElementById('github-7511afe3fc97f565d0d55f9a83e2273e-stargazers').innerHTML = data.stargazers_count; document.getElementById('github-7511afe3fc97f565d0d55f9a83e2273e-forks').innerHTML = data.forks; }) .catch(error = console.error(error))   ‎\nMystcraft is a Minecraft datapack Connor developed in 2021, adding teleportation books and 11 new dimensions all to vanilla minecraft using in-game commands.\nAbove are the links to the github repository and the planetminecraft page.
